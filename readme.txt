HUB3 payment details for Direct bank transfers (Croatian banks only) with barcode for mobile banking.

== Description ==

WSB HUB3 is a plugin for Woocommerce that shows all needed data for Croatian banks direct transfer payment, including on-the-fly generated barcode for mobile banking payment. Payment details and barcode are shown on thankyou page, order details page and also in notification email. Details are visible only if selected payment method is Bank transfer and order status is the one selected in general settings (default: on-hold).
Plugin uses bigfish.software API to generate barcodes: https://hub3.bigfish.software/. 
You can display payment details to the customer either in text/html format, or generated HUB-3A slip in jpg with all details on it. 
If admin updates an order from the backend (i.e. adds a new product to the order or apply a coupon code), barcode and HUB3 slip will be re-created.
